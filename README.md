notification-center-android
===========================

Android demo application that implements a notification center (similar to NSNotificationCenter in iOS). A complete socket communication layer is implemented to send or receive commands to/from the socket server via the notification center.

This notification center is an extension of the observer pattern in Android and it can be used to broadcast notifications with objects to multiple UI, Network or any other logical level of a notification center in the scope of the application and catch notifications with appropriated methods.
